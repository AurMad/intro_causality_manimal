The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.\nTemporality: The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay)."

However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.\nPlausibility: A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).\nCoherence: Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that “lack of such evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations”.\nExperiment: “Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence”.\nAnalogy: The use of analogies or similarities between the observed association and any other associations."
